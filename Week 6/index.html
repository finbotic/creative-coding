        <h1>My first website</h1>
        <p>My stuff is really important. Definitely. Most assuredly. I'm definitely not playing for laughs here.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Hey by the</li>
            <li>way, this is</li>
            <li>an ordered list.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>Oh, and just thought I'd</li>
            <li>let you know: This here</li>
            <li>is an unordered list :]</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Actually incredible that the sentences "Hey by the way, this is an ordered list." and, "Oh and just thought I'd let you know: This here is an unordered list :]" have a word count divisible by three.</p>
        <p>...Counting the :], of course.</p>
