First of all! Pronouncing GUI as anything other than the acronym itself, “Gee-You-Eye”, is absolute madness. Goo-ey is just disturbing…
But, lets do that whole compare and contrast thing. First of all, looking at comparisons between the GUI based file explorer and the CLI based Command prompt/Powershell. Comparisons first - Overall, they share the same purpose: manipulating files. When comparing the two, though, thats where the comparisons end rather quickly. See, the GUI File explorer is easy to navigate, intuitive, like an onion with many many layers. But, in a lot of cases, its limiting because its too friendly upon the average user. As in, for the sake of not overwhelming a total novice, it hides crucial things, like your literal User directory. God only knows how it felt as a kid knowing that Windows+R gave you the ‘Run’ task, and ‘%appdata%’ led you somewhere. Minecraft modding as a kid really did feel like forbidden arcane knowledge, for several reasons.
As for the command prompt, it completely sacrifices the ease of use, for capability. You can do literally anything with the command prompt, it is quite literally a direct prompt for you to do whatever you want to the computer, and tell it to do whatever you want. On Windows, this system has a couple of caveats. The windows command prompt will straight up not allow you to do certain things. The integrity of the Kernel itself takes precedence over whatever the user wants to do. On a system like Linux, though, all of that is out the window. Tell the operating system to delete itself, tell your hard drive to flip every single bit on its memory, hell it doesn’t care. Your wish is its command (ha ha.) - for better or for worse! Hope you don’t screw up and delete System32, god knows so many have in the past.
