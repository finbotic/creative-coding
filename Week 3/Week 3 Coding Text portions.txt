Got a Grit of 2.4, I feel as though I've been directly called out LOL. ADHD is a massive contributor to these types of things - but there is a sort of cusp of no return that interlaces with the autism. If I can power through the ADHD for /just/ long enough to make it through the initial hurdles of starting something, then by fucking god I will not stop at anything to complete it.

As for the Challenges section - last semester is an easy example. My morale got extremely low in physics classes, and at midterms, I had a 32% in a class. But through sheer unadulterated determination, I clawed my way back to passing the class. I may not be able to easily start things, but I can at least attest to the fact that when the chips are down, I get shit DONE.
