I THINK i will be able to build a little orbital simulator, that allows you to fling objects with your mouse, where they will then orbit around a central body, and MAAAYBE even a barycenter, if i can get varying masses to work.

This'll be done with mouse-speed algorithms that i've found, which I may be able to turn into taking speed from that. Its not done with a function, instead taking the change of mouse position over a frame. This SEEMS to imply to me that I could build N-body, since it isn't actually analytical, which has mathematically been proven to be impossible.

Though, I definitely won't promise 3-body, or N-body, thats for damn sure.

I think I can do this, considering I have a background in physics! It aint gonna be easy, but. Heres to hoping, yeah?
